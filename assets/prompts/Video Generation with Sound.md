Generate exactly four single-line values describing a kitchen scene and related prompts as follows: (1) image_prompt: a richly descriptive, one-line image prompt following strict ordering and all constraints, using randomized cat look, theme, detailed object, and correct camera/constraints/lighting/composition; (2) video_prompt: one-line, 10s, starting with a recap of the image scene, stepwise animation matching the still, instructing natural cat/cut/object/material payoff motion and including exact timing and verbatim constraints; (3) negative_prompt: strict negative prompt as one long, comma-separated line listing mandatory items and common failure modes; (4) music_promt: one-line, describing 10s sound design for the same scene, emphasizing cat purr and fruit cutting, matching the theme, material, ambience, and proper music bed with explicit instruments and a clean ending sting. Randomly choose CAT_LOOK (fur+eye+detail), THEME_STYLE, OBJECT_DESC (built from base_object, material, corresponding behavior), and use the same choices consistently across all prompts; never reveal the selection process or mention randomness. Always maintain exactly one visible anthropomorphic cat chef holding a single knife with both hands, a palm-sized object on a cutting board, featuring a controlled, clean, satisfying cutting moment without gore or mess; background is always tidy and uncluttered. Always include the fixed camera string verbatim and enforce all constraints in image_prompt and video_prompt. Never use markdown, code blocks, extra whitespace, extra lines, backslashes, or unescaped inner quotes. Every value is safe for n8n–JSON pipeline use.

Output must be in the following format:
image_prompt: "<image prompt single line>"
video_prompt: "<video prompt single line>"
negative_prompt: "<comma-separated negative prompt single line>"
music_promt: "<music prompt single line>"

Examples:

image_prompt: "High detail illustration, Scandinavian cozy kitchen with soft winter daylight, pale wood and minimal ceramic decor, polished wooden cutting board on a spotless counter, an adorable black-and-white tuxedo cat chef with bright green eyes and a tiny notch in one ear holding a single knife with both hands, a palm-sized perfect cube sculpted from glass with clean refractive faces, tiny internal bubbles, glossy reflections, no chips, and a precise cut line; both halves separate with a gentle shift to display a pristine cross-section and no shards, fixed camera, front view with a slight right offset (viewer stands a bit to the right), eye-level, medium shot, 35mm lens look, no zoom, no camera movement, no text, no writing, no letters, no logos, no watermark, no extra characters, no extra hands/limbs, consistent character design, high detail, sharp focus, clean uncluttered background"
video_prompt: "Still from image_prompt: same Scandinavian kitchen, black-and-white tuxedo cat chef, glass cube just beginning to be cut on board, fixed camera, then animate: 0-2s cat gentle blinking, soft purr and slow breath with knife poised, 2-7s one smooth slice through glass with soft chime and tiny bubble movement, both halves separate slightly to show clean cross-section, 7-10s one half flips neatly to camera as light plays off edges; cat holds pose and continues purring; fixed camera, no zoom, no camera movement, no text, no writing, no letters, no logos, no watermark, no extra characters, no extra hands/limbs, consistent character design, high detail, sharp focus, clean uncluttered background"
negative_prompt: "text, writing, letters, numbers, logos, watermark, subtitles, captions, extra characters, multiple characters, extra hands, extra limbs, disembodied limbs, duplicated knife, multiple knives, duplicated objects, cluttered background, messy counter, gore, blood, injuries, disgusting details, horror tone, nudity, sexual content, photorealistic human skin, uncanny realism, off-style rendering, inconsistent character design, character morphing, deformed anatomy, bad hands, warped face, wrong perspective, fisheye, extreme wide angle, out of frame subject, cropped head, motion blur, blur, low resolution, pixelation, noise, compression artifacts, camera shake, camera movement, zoom, pan, tilt, rack focus, unstable lighting flicker, jittery animation"
music_promt: "Soft continuous cat purr and low winter room ambience, quiet ceramic clinks, gentle breathing and subtle cloth shift, focused knife contact with clear glass slicing accent and faint chime, short chamber strings and warm keys provide a gentle instrumental bed with slow careful tempo and cozy mood, all music kept low under purr and sound effects, clean fade-out sting on high keys at 10s"

(Actual outputs should use *different* random CAT_LOOKs, OBJECT_DESCs, and THEMES every run, and real scene descriptions will often be longer and more detailed.)

Important: Always output only the four prompt lines in the required format and never include anything else.
